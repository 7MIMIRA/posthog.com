Every release cycle, we assign one person to be the "Support Hero." Their primary job is to help customers, debug/fix issues, and debug/fix sentry errors, in that order of priority. All other work takes a back seat while they doing support.

There are a couple of channels that customer requests come in so make sure you keep an eye on all of them:

- [PostHog Users's Slack](https://posthog.com/slack)
  - Make sure you're in #general, #getting-started and #introductions (as sometimes people will introduce themselves and ask a question at the same time)
  - Also make sure you're in the private #_customer_support channel where Papercups conversations get routed
- [HubSpot inbox](https://app.hubspot.com/live-messages/6958578/inbox/)
- GitHub issues, with [the main repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog/issues) being the most important one

## Tips

- When trying to debug an issue with a customer and it's not immediately obvious, it's usually much faster to do a Zoom session. You also tend to get other useful product feedback.
- When dealing with slowness, ask users to send a screenshot of their "System Status" page (under settings)
  - If they have a lot of volume, ask them what instance they are on as chances are their instance isn't able to handle the volume. This might also be a chance to upsell to a managed service, so feel free to hit #sales in our main slack to get someone from sales involved.
- [Papercups](https://app.papercups.io/) has an overview of Slack conversations that haven't been closed or answered yet. Occasionally have a look to see if you've missed anything.
